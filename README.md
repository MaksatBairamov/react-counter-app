# react-counter-app
This project is a simple counter application built using React. It allows users to increment a counter value and reset it to zero. The main purpose of the project is to demonstrate basic React concepts such as state management using hooks (in this case, the useState hook), event handling, and rendering dynamic content based on state changes.
